# Pedestrian Dynamics


Welcome to the Pedestrian Dynamics Study Group's GitHub organization! Our aim is to be a central hub for all things related to the study of pedestrian dynamics. Here, you'll find a range of projects, spanning simulation, analysis, and visualization. We strive to build a comprehensive resource, powered by a collaborative and inclusive community.

## About Us

We are a collective of researchers, developers, and crowd-enthusiasts with a shared interest in pedestrian dynamics. Our organization aims to:

- Centralize codebases, projects, and resources related to pedestrian dynamics.
- Provide a platform for knowledge sharing and collaboration.
- Foster a community where everyone, regardless of their level of expertise, can contribute, learn, and share.

## Our Projects

You'll find various repositories hosted under our organization, covering a wide array of topics and technologies related to pedestrian dynamics:

- **Simulation**: Projects aimed at creating realistic simulations of pedestrian movements and behaviors.
- **Analysis**: Tools and projects that help understand, interpret, and derive insights from data related to pedestrian dynamics.
- **Visualization**: Innovative tools and platforms to visualize pedestrian movements, behaviors, and trends.

You can browse our repositories to find a project of your interest.
